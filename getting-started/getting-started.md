# GETTING STARTED

Blanket Clusterer is made of **2** main modules:
- Python clustering module (Python)
- Web Application (Python Flask + ReactJS)
 
This repository contains the Python Flask + ReactJS web application, which will allow users
to easily use Blanket Clusterer python module. 

You will need to download the module from [the repository](https://github.com/Konstantin-Bogdanoski/Blanket-Clusterer-Module), 
 also if you'd like, you can use the Web Application from [this repository](https://github.com/Konstantin-Bogdanoski/Blanket-Clusterer-GUI).
 
For starting up your application, head over to [Python Module](python-module.md) to check the steps needed to start the module,
 and [Web Application](web-application.md) to check out the steps needed to start the Web Application.
