# PYTHON MODULE

## Setup

The python module will be ready to use, as soon as you install the necessary requirements
using `pip`, as shown:

```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the requirements, the module is ready for usage.
You could use it through a **terminal**, or you could use the [Web Application](web-application.md).

Head over to [Usage](../documentation/usage.md) to check out how to use the module.
