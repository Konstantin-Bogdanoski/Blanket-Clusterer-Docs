# BLANKET CLUSTERER
> Current version: v0.9

Blanket Clusterer:
-   Is a hierarchical clustering algorithm
-   Is a generic algorithm (built upon existing clustering algorithms from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/))
-   Works with Word2Vec models, to cluster vectors
-   Implements a 3D visualization tool, courtesy of [CarrotSearch's](https://carrotsearch.com/) [FoamTree](https://get.carrotsearch.com/foamtree/demo/)

This module was build upon an idea to help data scientist cluster and hierarchically visualize their data, with as little
effort as possible.

Any feedback and constructive criticism is welcome!
