# BLANKET CLUSTERER
> Current version: v3.0.0

Blanket Clusterer:
-   Is a hierarchical clustering algorithm
- Is a generic algorithm (built upon existing clustering algorithms
  from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/))
- Works with all NLP models, to cluster vectors (although the embeddings need to be in a certain format)
- Implements a 3D visualization tool, courtesy
  of [CarrotSearch's](https://carrotsearch.com/) [FoamTree](https://get.carrotsearch.com/foamtree/demo/)

This module was build upon an idea to help data scientist cluster and hierarchically visualize their data, with as
little effort as possible.

Any feedback and/or constructive criticism is welcome!
